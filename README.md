# EECE 487 Robotics: Velocity Kinematics

## Part 3 of 3

The project involved the modeling of a 6-degree-of-freedom SCARA robot in Matlab Simulink. All sections controlled the model arm using a Novint Falcon controller.

Part 3 used velocity kinematics to map the controller position and motion to the joint rates, and used Matlab to calculate and display the configuration of the arm.

The collection of files is not functional, as it is missing the config files specific to the lab setup.
